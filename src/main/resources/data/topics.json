    "overview": "Universal Basic Income (UBI) gives all citizens a regular, unconditional sum. Supporters say it simplifies welfare and cushions automation shocks; critics worry about fiscal cost, inflation, and labor supply effects.",
    "pro": [
      "Provides a floor against poverty and income shocks.",
      "Simplifies welfare administration and reduces leakage.",
      "Supports entrepreneurship and risk-taking.",
      "Helps transition during automation-driven job losses.",
      "Reduces stigma associated with targeted benefits."
    ],
    "con": [
      "High fiscal burden may force tax hikes or cuts elsewhere.",
      "May reduce labor participation at the margin.",
      "Could raise prices for essentials like rent.",
      "Uniform payout ignores regional cost-of-living differences.",
      "Opportunity cost versus healthcare or education spending."

    "pro": [
      "Better protection of minors from explicit content.",
      "Improves accountability and reporting mechanisms.",
      "Enables minor-specific safer design defaults."
    ],
    "con": [

  "topic": "Will AI take away jobs of humans",
  "overview": "Debate centers on whether AI-driven automation will permanently displace large portions of the workforce or mostly reshape tasks, creating new roles while eliminating some routine ones.",
  "pro": [
    "History shows routine and clerical roles shrink when automation arrives; AI expands what can be automated beyond physical tasks.",
    "Generative AI reduces demand for entry-level content, support, and basic coding, concentrating work into fewer, higher-skill roles.",
    "Firms that adopt AI can produce the same output with fewer workers, creating a net displacement in the short to medium term.",
    "Re-skilling lags behind technology adoption; displaced workers may not transition quickly enough.",
    "AI substitutes for cognitive tasks once thought safe, widening the set of at-risk jobs."
  ],
  "con": [
    "Technology has historically been a net job creator; new roles (prompt engineering, AI ops, data governance) emerge.",
    "AI mostly automates tasks, not whole jobs; productivity gains translate into new products and services that need people.",
    "Human skills—empathy, complex coordination, accountability—remain scarce and complementary to AI.",
    "Policy levers (training subsidies, wage insurance, transition support) can offset displacement.",
    "Lower costs can boost demand and employment in adjacent sectors."
  ],
  "facts": [
    "Automation first targets routine, repetitive tasks—both manual and cognitive.",
    "Short-run displacement can coexist with long-run job creation.",
    "Impact varies by industry, education, and local adoption rates."
